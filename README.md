Since this is an unofficial app, use it at your own risk (although there shouldn't be any problems since all the code changed is just replacing APIs).

The source code was obtained by a trivial call of the public fern flower decompiler with the shared application ePorezi
and served only to provide users of this public interest system better working conditions (and all due to the incompetence of the original authors).
